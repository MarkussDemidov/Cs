Thank you for using Cs!

string = text
int = number
double = fractional
bool / boolean = turner
cout = input
cin = output

FULL EXPLAINING

This was made to simplify coding in C++!


VARIABLES:
To create text / string variables, use 

text textName = "YOUR TEXT HERE"
// text name = "Markuss"

To create number / intiger variables, use

number numberName = INSERT A NUMBER HERE
// number age = 1

To create a number / integer with fractionals, use

fractional fractionalName = INSERT A NUMBER WITH FRACTIONALS HERE.
fractional grade = 8.5

To create a bool / boolean / True False / Switch, use

turner turnerOn = true / false;
turner student = true;


COMMAND LINE:

To make text show up in the command line, use
output << "YOUR TEXT HERE!";
output << "Hello, how are you?";

If you want to make a new line, aka clearing space so the next 
text doesn't get stuck together with the last one, use:

output << "TEXT HERE" << endl;
endl = end line!



To add user input, add a text variable, and use:
text inputStorer;
input >> inputStorer;

THANK YOU!
